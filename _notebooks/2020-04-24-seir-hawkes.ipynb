    "# The Relation between the SEIR Epidemic Model and Hawkes Processes\n",
    "> Recently, a link between the SIR compartmental epidemic model and Hawkes-like processes was found. This opens up the possibility to use some of the rich theory related to Hawkes processes when analyzing spreads of diseases using the SIR model. As the SIR model is not capable of modeling incubation times – a feature inherent in Covid-19 and many other diseases – there is a need to extend the recently found link to more complex compartmental epidemic models like the SEIR model. We have discovered this link and present it briefly in this blog post. For a detailed derivation of our results and a more in-depth discussion please refer to <a href=\"https://todo\">our paper</a>.\n",
